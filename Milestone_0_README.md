# Milestone 0: The Plan

## Project Concept: Mawareth (Inheritance & Estate Management)
**Mawareth** is a comprehensive Fin-Tech platform designed to simplify and digitize the complex process of inheritance distribution. It empowers heirs to manage estates, vote on asset distribution, trade inherited assets in a specialized marketplace, and access financial buyouts for quick liquidity.

## Features & Use Cases
We have identified the following core use cases. The **System Architecture & Administration** and **Authentication** have been combined to create a consolidated "Lead" workload.

1.  **User Authentication & System Administration (Heavy Load)**
    -   *Authentication*: Secure Registration, Login, JWT handling, Password Encryption.
    -   *Authorization*: Role-based access control (Heir vs Admin vs Agent) and protected routes.
    -   *Admin Dashboard*: A centralized view for system administrators to oversee all users, estates, and system activity.
    -   *Profile Management*: Comprehensive user profile editing and verification status.
2.  **Estate Management & Consensus**
    -   Create digital estates for deceased individuals.
    -   Add heirs and assets to estates.
    -   Voting system for heirs to agree on asset distribution (Accept/Reject).
3.  **Solh Marketplace**
    -   List distressed or disputed assets for sale.
    -   External buyers (or other heirs) can view and bid on assets.
    -   "Unlock" listing details feature.
4.  **Buyout Applications (Finance)**
    -   Heirs can apply for immediate cash buyouts of their shares.
    -   Financial agents review and update application status.
5.  **AI Legal Assistant (Chatbot)**
    -   Interactive chat interface for legal and financial queries.
    -   Context-aware assistance for navigating the inheritance process.

## Data Modeling (Mongoose Schemas)

### User (Auth & Admin)
-   `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (heir/admin/agent), `phone`, `isVerified`, `adminNotes`.

### Estate
-   `deceasedName`, `assets` (Array of objects), `heirs` (Array of users + shares), `status` (Pending/Distributed), `consensus` (Voting tracking).

### MarketplaceListing
-   `title`, `description`, `price`, `type` (Real Estate/Gold/etc), `estateId`, `status`.
